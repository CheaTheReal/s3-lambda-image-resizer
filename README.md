# üñºÔ∏è AWS Lambda S3 Image Resizer

This project automatically resizes uploaded images using AWS Lambda, triggered by S3 events, and delivers optimized images globally via CloudFront.

## ‚úÖ What It Does

- Accepts image uploads to an S3 bucket (`chea-image-source`)
- Triggers a Lambda function written in Python using Pillow
- Resizes images to 128x128
- Saves resized versions to another S3 bucket (`chea-image-resized`)
- Delivers them globally via CloudFront CDN
